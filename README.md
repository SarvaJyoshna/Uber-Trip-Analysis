# **Uber Trip Analysis:**

**Motivation:**
In our day-to-day life, we must go to several places for various purposes like work, study, education, eat etc. So, we must travel through something to get to the place. And Uber is one of the most used travel facility these days. Uber is a platform where those who drive and deliver can connect with riders, eaters, and restaurants. 
I always used to wonder about these innumerable uber trips per day in cities. I’ve always wanted to analyse these trip data and gain an estimate knowledge about the uber trips and that is how I began this project.

**Tools/technologies/methodologies:**
This project is implemented using Python language and Jupyter notebook. We perform analysis on uber trip data. The libraries used in this project are Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and, Seaborn. Different types of datasets are imported using Pandas library. The NumPy library is used with the arrays. Graphs are plotted using the Matplotlib library. Heatmap is plotted using the seaborn library. 
First, select the dataset from Kaggle and download it. Then import all the necessary libraries and perform pre-processing. After pre-processing, dataset comparison is done using the libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
Then we perform several types of data analysis like comparing business vs personal trips, the frequency for the purpose of the trip, checking how many are the round trips, evaluating the frequency of the trip in each month, and so on.
The order of major steps that we perform in the project are as follows:
1.	Reading dataset
2.	Checking for null values
3.	Finding duplicate values & removing them
4.	Converting start and end dates to Datetime format
5.	Plotting Business vs Personal Trips
6.	Plotting Frequency of the Purpose of Trip
7.	Checking the count of ROUND TRIPS 
8.	Evaluating Frequency of Trip in each Month
9.	Plotting Round Trip against Months
10.	Plotting Mean distance of Trip w.r.t Category
11.	Plotting Category wise Trip per day

**Skills (technical and otherwise):**
From this project, I’ve drawn valuable insights from Uber trip data. This helped me in getting a better understanding on the transportation system that we daily travel in. I’ve also learnt plotting various types of graphs. 

**Impact/obstacles:**
This project taught me that we can analyse and draw insights from almost any situation in our day-to-day life. This helped me in getting a better understanding on the transportation system that we daily travel in.
